Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum: a machine-corrected EpiDoc version of public domain volumes of the monumental collection of Latin Church Fathers. 

Each volume is encoded in accordance with the latest EpiDoc standards (CTS-compliant). Each XML file contains a link to the Archive.org scan the text was taken from as well as Perseus Catalog URIs (where available). 

The files in the UniKonstanz folder (https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/csel-dev/tree/master/UniKonstanz) have been improved as follows: enhancement of serial chapter numbering in cooperation with Dr. Christian Gr√ºn (Chair of Database and Information Systems), correction of locus numbering and proofreading done by Marie Revellio (Chair of Latin Philology) both at the University of Konstanz.
